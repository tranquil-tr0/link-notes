# Priority
- folder support
- test import/export when data is stored in app storage
    - remove import/export settings options when data is not in app internal storage
- add welcome screen to prompt a selection of data location on start


# Less priority
- replace initial "no notes" with loading screen instead
- settings option for note sorting mode (recent, alphabetical)
- haptics

# Polish
- consider forking markdown editor or making an editor or whatever else (better editor)
- *maybe* I'll look at the note cards again
- material you theme
- importable color theme
- change style of top bar (search bar) to be full width search items inside, plus on bottom center or right (mabe configurable?)
    - hide the top bar on scroll
- look into optimizing start times
- consider setting to not show note title if it starts with "Untitled"
