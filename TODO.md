# Priority
- haptics


# Less priority
- settings option for note sorting mode (recent, alphabetical)
- fix the theme select buttons
- consider a voice note quick settings tile - audio file or transcribe by calling the system dictation thing
- consider uploading images, videos, audio into vault
- move settings persistence into settings instead of FileSystemService

# Polish
- duplicate notes storage to improve loading time (by not requiring IO to show initial content)
- replace initial "no notes" with loading screen instead
- consider forking markdown editor or making an editor or whatever else (better editor)
- *maybe* I'll look at the note cards again
- material you theme
- importable color theme
- change style of top bar (search bar) to be full width search items inside, plus on bottom center or right (mabe configurable?)
    - hide the top bar on scroll
- look into optimizing start times
- consider setting to not show note title if it starts with "Untitled"
